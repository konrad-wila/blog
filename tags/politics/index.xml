      <title>The PPC Has a Terrible Housing Platform</title>
      <link>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/the-ppc-has-a-terrible-housing-platform/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The PPC platform on housing is terrible! The PPC&amp;rsquo;s housing platform is so bad that even if immigration is reduced to 0, their other policies would result in less houses being built:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modify the Bank of Canada’s inflation target, from 2% to 0%. This will cool down inflation in all sectors, including housing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the strategies the Bank of Canada uses to reduce inflation, is by raising interest rates; the cost of borrowing is higher for both buyers and businesses. They don&amp;rsquo;t have a clue that cooling the housing market isn&amp;rsquo;t because housing becomes more affordable, but because higher interest rates reduce demand for housing at every price level and worse it also reduces supply at all levels. An inflation target of 0% could be good, but a housing shortage is not a good time to enact such a policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respect local and provincial governments’ responsibility for housing policies. They must be accountable to their citizens and not be subject to federal pressure to “densify” neighbourhoods of single-family homes in order to accommodate mass immigration policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They completely disregard that SFH&amp;rsquo;s are actually Two-Family Houses in Brampton, Ontario. They think densification is a pressure by the feds as if green belt isn&amp;rsquo;t the reason we need to densify. Like seriously, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if you only allow SFH&amp;rsquo;s, when basements get rented out. Do they want people to live in basements or do they want people to actually own their own unit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Privatize or dismantle the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a mammoth government agency that fuels the housing crisis instead of helping to cool it down. All it has ever done is encourage Canadians to buy houses they can’t afford, and accumulate massive amounts of debt that the federal government, and ultimately Canadian taxpayers, will be responsible for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this platform is all about keeping housing out of reach. The platform completely disregards that there is a housing shortage, not a future demand issues. Without CMHC, people that put a lower downpayment have to pay higher interest rates since they won&amp;rsquo;t be able to get insured. Like what? Make housing even more out of reach?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These policies simply aren&amp;rsquo;t that deep and their housing strategy is a huge gamble of thinking that new immigrants are capable of buying properties. Owning is ~50% more expensive than renting in the present. Reducing immigration only freezes the shortage; it doesn&amp;rsquo;t fix the shortage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Canada is Worse because of Justin Trudeau</title>
      <link>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/canada-is-worse-becuase-of-justin-trudeau/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 23 Feb 2024 21:59:01 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/canada-is-worse-becuase-of-justin-trudeau/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;These days, chronically online Canadians are absolutely wild. They complain about bills that they didn&amp;rsquo;t even read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-trudeau-was-elected&#34; &gt;Why Trudeau was Elected
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#why-trudeau-was-elected&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canadian governments were not squeaky clean. While researching, the information I&amp;rsquo;ve come across point that both Liberals and Conservatives were not clean. Obviously, it was time for Harper to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;demeanor&#34; &gt;Demeanor
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#demeanor&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justin Trudeau is very inauthentic when he speaks. It is always speaking down and never speaking at the same level as us. Want proof? In a town hall, a woman who asked a genuine question about mental health services for English speakers got an answer in French&amp;hellip;The rationale was because they were in Quebec and most people were French speakers. A town hall is a chance for citizens to get answers to their number one question for the prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/trudeau-town-hall-sherbrooke-quebec-public-questions-1.3940058&#34;&gt;All questions were answered in French&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;snc-lavalin-affair&#34; &gt;SNC-Lavalin Affair
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#snc-lavalin-affair&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Liberal government was broadsided by allegations that officials in the Prime Minister’s Office, after repeated lobbying by SNC-Lavalin, tried to convince former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to strike a mediation deal instead of pursuing fraud and corruption charges against the Quebec-based engineering giant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is corporate cronyism from a party and its supporters who claim that the Conservatives do the bidding of Canadian corporations. Fun fact, telecom executives hated Steven Harper since he wanted to bring in Verizon from the US to compete with Canadian telecommunication companies. Harper lost votes for not following in line with the Canadian telecommunication companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Premier Smith of Alberta did a similar thing by the way recently regarding a case where the defendant was blockading the border and being mischievous in general. Ethical commissioner deemed in incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;indigenous-issues&#34; &gt;Indigenous Issues
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#indigenous-issues&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;These mass graves were not actually mass graves yet the federal government created a whole federal holiday from it; reactionary virtue. It solved zero indigenous problems. There&amp;rsquo;s land disputes right now in BC where indigenous people are losing land they claim is theres to a pipeline company. If the federal government wants to claim it&amp;rsquo;s actually doing good for the indigenous people, then focus on issuing a statement so that there will be peace in that region instead of one side claiming that they are right and the other side which the court sides with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;covid-19&#34; &gt;COVID-19
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#covid-19&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 is when Trudeau could not be redeemed. First of all, there were so many restrictions. Doug Ford is not conservative either, and I&amp;rsquo;m glad I never voted for him. He is no different than the federal Liberals. So what are the problems with COVID-19?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CERB: the government mandated lockdowns and then gave everyone free money. Of course this caused inflation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Government Overreach: Border Entry Restrictions
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imagine forcing Canadians to get tested just to re-enter the country. Otherwise pay $6,000 to enter the country. Oh and then there&amp;rsquo;s random testing requirements as well. The only reason my family got through the border was because all of us were forced to get tested&amp;hellip;Let&amp;rsquo;s see here Canada, allow people who tested positive for COVID-19 in and make them mandatory, but if someone doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a test, assume they have something worse than being COVID-positive. It&amp;rsquo;s ridiculous. The policy should&amp;rsquo;ve been: get tested negative to not have to quarantine, or else you are assumed to have covid and then you should quarantine. We had to do the COVID testing on a live video call. It was a waste of resources and front-line workers&amp;rsquo; time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;we-charity-scandal&#34; &gt;WE Charity Scandal

    &lt;a href=&#34;#we-charity-scandal&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;awarding of a federal contract to WE Charity to administer the $912 million Canada Student Service Grant program (CSSG)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You read that right. The federal government allows citizens to deduct charity donations yet gives money to charities that pay the family members of the prime minister. Absolutely disgusting. During COVID, the government should be taking over investment that the private industry would not be doing. We could&amp;rsquo;ve had such a big jump on the housing shortage, but nope, almost a billion dollars was apparently available for the Canada Student Service Grant program (CSSG) during one of the worst budget deficits ($327.7B) in this country&amp;rsquo;s history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know what the program was for? Paying volunteers. That&amp;rsquo;s right, instead of sustainable jobs being created during a time of high unemployment, it&amp;rsquo;s better to just pay people to volunteer (service-based).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;participants will only be able to count hours accumulated from June 25 to October 31, 2020.
Having students conduct WE Charity work at a reduced wage in the form of volunteerism which was previously conducted by paid employees&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a horrible program as you had to register by August 21, but could only count for a selected few months anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prime minister said that only WE Charity could administer this program, but&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other organizations, such as the Public Service Alliance of Canada and YMCA Canada, expressed skepticism at the claim that WE Charity was the only organization in Canada capable of administering the contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;$60M for a goddamn app that didn&amp;rsquo;t let me into the country and enjoy my full rights anyways? And the system we have now is extremely simple. My family came back from the Dominican Republic and they have these pillar system that take pictures of you and the entire system is a physical slip of paper with just your name on it. The pillar took a picture of my dad twice and the agents just let us through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So $60 million dollars was spent on an app that reduced efficiency and isn&amp;rsquo;t even used for entering the country today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where is the accountability. The firm, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/gc-strategies-arrivecan-1.7120381&#34;&gt;GC Strategies&lt;/a&gt; has gotten a quarter of a billion dollars since Liberals came into power. The company would keep 15-30% as a commission to subcontract the awards it would get. How is a system so bad that a contractor can take a higher commission than what Apple and Google take at the mobile stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;housing-and-immigration&#34; &gt;Housing (and Immigration)
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#housing-and-immigration&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, housing and immigration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Housing to income ratios are the highest they&amp;rsquo;ve been. Canada with a population of 40 million has an index 148.16, followed by Germany at 140.6, where most people rent and the population is 83.2 million. We have more land!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Record international students that were not vetted and were sold a lie. The company funneling this, ApplyBoard, unfortunately has University of Waterloo founders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immigration itself is out of control. Canada needs 200,000 per year to make up for the low birth rate, but what Canada does not need is a skewed gender ratio and neither does it need 471,550 immigrants excluding students. The net migration was over a million people (add non-permanent residents)&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Housing shortage in Canada is due to NIMBYism. NIMBYs want to prevent urban sprawl but at the same time do not want houses to be denser. This, combined with a growing population causes a housing shortage. The solutions are simple, reduce immigration, reduce inflation (and thus interest rates), create new cities, allow both urban sprawl and density (both solutions are better than one), and lastly, increase the efficiency of the LTBs so that more people are open to land lording and not just corporations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;luxury-tax&#34; &gt;Luxury Tax
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#luxury-tax&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently, paying a percentage in taxes on items your purchase is not enough. With HST of 13%, a $100 item has a tax of $13, and a $100,000 item has a tax of $13,000. But that isn&amp;rsquo;t enough for the government. Not only is it not enough, the good being purchased can &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/ltn2/subject-vehicles-under-select-luxury-items-tax-act.html&#34;&gt;affect the rate too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if rich people want to bid up the price of investment properties past a million dollars, that&amp;rsquo;s fine. Only above $3,000,000 is it a problem. But if you, a middle class, person, purchase a modest home, save money your entire life want to purchase a corvette while your going through your midlife crisis, nope please pay an extra 20% on the amount over 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For boats, it&amp;rsquo;s above $250,000! This is insane. So I get punished for having just a car, but the person who splurges on both cars and a boat, gets away with it. This is ridiculous, and this tax is too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why tax vehicles but not Richard Milles or other luxury watches? Why not all jewellery? Or cottages? Or art?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wonder why real GDP per capita is rarely growing, and it&amp;rsquo;s because the government thinks that the economy can improve even when taxes are known to  reduce demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lied about ending first past the post. Even when exploring alternatives, his party and followers were apprehensive about ranked voting, which is not good for proportional representation at a national view. Ranked is good for mayoral elections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not only did he not keep his promise for affordable housing for Canadians, rent become parabolic. &lt;a href=&#34;https://liberal.ca/trudeau-promises-affordable-housing-for-canadians/&#34;&gt;https://liberal.ca/trudeau-promises-affordable-housing-for-canadians/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www03.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/hmip-pimh/en/TableMapChart/Table?TableId=2.2.11&amp;amp;GeographyId=2270&amp;amp;GeographyTypeId=3&amp;amp;DisplayAs=Table&amp;amp;GeograghyName=Toronto&#34;&gt;https://www03.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/hmip-pimh/en/TableMapChart/Table?TableId=2.2.11&amp;amp;GeographyId=2270&amp;amp;GeographyTypeId=3&amp;amp;DisplayAs=Table&amp;amp;GeograghyName=Toronto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Didn’t stop Doug Ford from allowing colleges to ask for so many international student visas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bill C-21, which demonized sports shooters. The NDP was only against this because it affected indigenous people, not because it affected non-indigenous Canadians.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He enacted authoritative border policies during the pandemic where Canadians were forced to get results of a COVID test just to enter the country, or pay a fine, or get mandatory testing anyways. If you tested positive, you would still be let into the country but have to quarantine, but if you didn’t get tested, you would have to pay $6,000 instead of just being forced to quarantine. It was one of the most irrational policies I’ve ever been subjected to in this country. The only reason we had to leave the country was because a family friend was mourning the death of her husband.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He keeps lying about the carbon tax omitting that it has an economic impact. Instead of using the carbon tax to actually reverse emissions, the money is given back even though the economic impact is worse for most. Additionally, there’s a $1B slush fund but there were conflicting of interest issues. There’s no priority to make Canada the number one nation in carbon capture technology. We already have a carbon tax, so investing it into carbon capture technology is a no brainer. If I was the prime minister, I’d be building so many of these carbon capture plants in cities in Canada that lack jobs. The average GDP per capita in Canada is not found everywhere in Canada. There are many small towns with a sense of abandonment and a lack of blue collar jobs. It’s just filled with one Tim Hortons, an ice cream parlour, and some small houses. Lots of wild life, but a severe lack of housing so only a limited number of people can enjoy it. The government should actively force governments to deregulate zoning in exchange for building these carbon capture plants that will bring in sustainable jobs. Furthermore, the government can inform its citizens how to properly measure how much emissions they are responsible for and allowing us to pay money to these carbon capture crown corporations in exchange for a tax credit deduction similar to charities and political donations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He keeps pushing for bills such as the online harms bill that result in more bureaucracy to regulate the Internet for speech that is already illegal. In Canada hate speech is already illegal, that Chilliwack woman was arrested by the RCMP! The bill is expected to cost us $200M when we don’t even have a balanced primary budget (the budget excluding interest payments). We also spend $30B annually for non-recurring indigenous reparations. Immigrants who didn’t colonize nor oppress Indigenous are paying taxes to correct mistakes made by the ancestors of wealthy Canadians who have been in the country for hundreds of years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He uses terminology such as people kind to intentionally divide and rattle people up. He could have used humankind. Regardless “mankind” is not sexist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allows the LMIA system to go wild without clampdowns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let 10,000 H1Bs come into Canada and essentially steal away jobs from Computer Science graduates from the University of Waterloo who paid $80,000+ across 5 years only to end up unemployed or getting a job that pays 80,000 in 2024. In 2019, before joining university my new grad income goal was 100,000 in 2019. That’s 118,321 in 2024 terms. Although I am outdoing my goals, my friend is not only just below this, he is also paying 1900 in rent for a studio. According to CMHC, rent for a bachelor across Canada is “1414” and in 2019 it was “1142.” So essentially, he is paying 1900 instead of 1347 (inflation adjusted rent), which is a loss of $6636. So the adjusted income software engineers from UW should be making is $125,000. The only reason I exceeded my income goals is because I’m ambitious and used niche technology. We shouldn’t all have to be Leetcode gods just to make a living for our skillsets (i.e. working for a high frequency trading firm). Also not all of us with the same skill level will get job/internships at mid market cap firms or big tech. Furthermore, the barriers to starting a company are insane. Not only do I have to deal with my parents’ expectations of working a normal job, there’s barely any way to pay rent if I want to go against my parents’ wishes. Ideally, accelerators should give you a grant equal to 1.5 years worth of living expenses. This translates to at most $41400 in today’s terms, but if rent was at 2015’s levels (937 or 1200 in 2024), then the grant would only need to be at most $27,000. The minimum a grant should be is for 1 years worth of leg room or $26,400 in 2024 and $18,000 if rent was $1200/mo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the pandemic the Liberal government issued many bonds to the central bank and instead of investing in jobs to pay people to produce goods and services and wealth, it was just issued to people who claimed to have been impacted. This is why I believe that the government should only expand in times of distress and recessions, as unemployment is two-fold. One is from the mismatch ratio of businesses to humans, which causes a labour surplus, and the other is due to a matching issues where businesses are looking for people with certain skills and are unable to find them and people with certain skills are available but no jobs exist for them. When the government hires, they are bound to the charter of rights and freedoms and are to set an example of what it means to be a good employer. What this means is that even if the private industry only hires experienced workers, the government who sets the minimum wage must be the employer of last resort which forces businesses to compete for these now experienced workers via a higher wage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SNC-Lavellin Scandal &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-wilson-raybould-attorney-general-snc-lavalin-1.5014271&#34;&gt;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-wilson-raybould-attorney-general-snc-lavalin-1.5014271&lt;/a&gt; . This company (now known as AtkinsRéalis) had lobbied the government to introduce deferred prosecution agreement, which allows for financial penalties in lieu of criminal conviction, however the prosecutor must not weigh economic impacts of a conviction when pursuing charges. Trudeau was directly involved in pressuring the attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould to secure a deferred prosecution agreement. In my humble opinion, bribing foreign nations, especially developing countries, should not be illegal, especially if its towards the existing government. Why should Canada be concerned whether leaders of foreign states are accepting bribes? That&amp;rsquo;s on their constituents. It&amp;rsquo;s either to bribe, or to lose business because some other companies bribe. It&amp;rsquo;s no different than charging royalties and using windfall taxes. It&amp;rsquo;s a cost of doing business. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/libya-snc-1.5014939&#34;&gt;https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/libya-snc-1.5014939&lt;/a&gt; . There is no ethical qualms about bribing someone. There is 100% moral qualms about accepting bribes. Ethically speaking, bribing someone is a tax. The person is forcing you to pay a bribe to get something done. What is funny is that lobbying is no different. The Liberals did include the DPA because SNC lobbied the Liberals. The government is a hypocrite for allowing lobbying, safe name for bribing, but not for paying a non-standard tax in a foreign nation. Honestly speaking, any body who accepts donations from corporations and actually does what they are lobbying for is corrupt. SNC isn&amp;rsquo;t the problem, Gadaffi is. From a Libyan perspective, they are simply taxing a foreign state. It would actually be embezzlement if Gaddafi was taking that &amp;ldquo;bribe&amp;rdquo; for himself and not the states chest. Still these are issues of developing countries. The only way to defend a stance of disallowing foreign bribing is if there was also a condition that any foreign political actor who forces a Canadian corporation to be bribe will automatically be internationally charged. That is how you do things. It does not matter though, because with Monero, there will be no financial paper trail that a bribe even occurred. Trust is something that is enforced on onesself, not on others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He added the luxury tax and made it very opinionated. Any motor vehicle worth over $100,000+  even if its electric like the Porsche Taycan or Tesla Model S. You are forced to buy a Model 3, Y, X if you want a family electric car that is good. Aircrafts also over $100,000. Vessels though? That&amp;rsquo;s right, only over $250,000, because someone who can afford a family car and a $200,000 boat is actually less rich than the person who just wants a Lexus LC 500, Corvette C8, Porsche Taycan, Porsche Panamera, Porsche 911. Rich people who own houses worth over $1,000,000? Not only do you not pay a luxury tax on homes priced above $2,000,000, you also don&amp;rsquo;t pay capital gains tax if your house appreciated by $1,000,000. Even a secondary home is not taxed, because owning cottages is more middle class than buying those luxury cars I listed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vacationing to his billionaire friends&amp;rsquo; islands because billionaires maintain friends with people who tax the rich right? It&amp;rsquo;s clear that his policies harm the middle class who want to experience a luxurious life style, and limit access to this luxury to people who are 10x richer who can easily afford these goods. That&amp;rsquo;s why the tax is high enough for the middle class to be dissuaded from purchasing these goods, but not high enough that individuals with a net worth over $100M question the purchase. If the government wants to impose a luxury tax, then make it applicable to cars that aren&amp;rsquo;t bought by the middle class. And make it 100% instead of the rate it currently is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cost of living is insane, nationally. Blame Russia or claim its ubiquitous worldwide, however nothing is being done to alleviate the pain by investing in industries which are the blockers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WE charity scandal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ArriveCAN due to non-competitive bidding, although costs were $50M during a period where jobs were about to start dropping in the tech industry. Not to mention, the firm that was awarded the contract was of two non-technical people. The firm specialized in outsourcing to subcontractors, not actually doing the work themselves. This means that the entire system was corrupt for allowing this sort of slimy middle man behaviour to take place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoiding answering questions and instead repeating the same generic lines. just watch him in Parliament.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tried to force Meta and Google to pay for simply sharing news links. If you share a news link through Meta&amp;rsquo;s app, the other user cannot even click on it because Meta will block showing it. Our regulations are so ridiculous that companies just do a full no no. This is what happened with AI with Meta not releasing their models in the EU, even though this is all digital.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Corruption in Canada</title>
      <link>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/corruption-in-canada/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 17 May 2023 22:29:02 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/corruption-in-canada/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a list of topics and links that show how corrupt Canada can be at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/governors-general-billed-over-88000-in-clothing-to-taxpayers-since-2017-documents&#34;&gt;Governors general billed over $88,000 in clothing to taxpayers since 2017: documents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CEO of BC Housing Scandal was married to the CEO of Atira, which is a non-profit that gets funded by BC housing. On top of the egregious conflict of interest that was allowed by the board of directors, Atira sometimes won contracts without any bidding involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion%2Fgerard-comeau-beer-smuggler-and-our-new-national-hero/article37258839/&#34;&gt;Canada&amp;rsquo;s beer smuggler is our new national hero&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R v. Comeau&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012, the police of New Brunswick conducted a sting operation that resulted in a $300 ticket. What for? Simply for &amp;ldquo;smuggling&amp;rdquo; alcohol across province lines. Comeau had purchased cheaper beer in Quebec and brought it back to New Brunswick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.iedm.org/sites/default/files/web/pub_files/Ipsos_poll1117_en.pdf&#34;&gt;Ipos&lt;/a&gt;, 78% of 1,100 Canadians surveyed, think people should be allowed to buy any amount of alcohol from another province and bring it back home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case is evidence that Canada is a broken democracy. Even when the majority of people want something, the minority in power will make decisions that go against the beliefs and values of Canadians under some excuse they inevitably come up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First past the post can probably be blamed to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mental illnesses cause forest fires&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lakelandtoday.ca/local-news/glendon-woman-charged-with-32-counts-of-arson-3844982&#34;&gt;Glendon woman charged with 32 counts of arson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National Post does not even link to the report. They just pick out one number. Sure the government is in the wrong, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you can&amp;rsquo;t do a better job reporting on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pbo-dpb.ca/en/publications/RP-2223-001-S--budget-2022-issues-parliamentarians--budget-2022-considerations-parlementaires&#34;&gt;Budget 2022: Issues for parliamentarians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the economy is $1T, and the government is spending $1T, then 50% of the economy is done inefficiently. Canada is almost a communist country.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What Is Abuse? Regarding the Steven Crowder Video</title>
      <link>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/steven-crowder-emotional-abuse/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 29 Apr 2023 00:56:25 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/steven-crowder-emotional-abuse/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the latest revelation of Steven Crowder&amp;rsquo;s improper behaviour towards his almost ex-wife shown in the article linked in the tweet below, it&amp;rsquo;s very clear that a considerable portion of people (at least on the internet) are poor at comprehending what abuse is. I&amp;rsquo;ve transcribed the video into text using &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/openai/whisper&#34;&gt;openai-whisper&lt;/a&gt; and attached it at the bottom for your reference as the website linked is very bloated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;1. EXCLUSIVE &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve obtained over three minutes of video of Steven Crowder being emotionally abusive toward his pregnant wife, Hilary. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a statement sent to me, her family says she hid the emotional abuse she was dealing with for years. &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/U28rGt2aSH&#34;&gt;https://t.co/U28rGt2aSH&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/ZN8ai04fvK&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/ZN8ai04fvK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/yashar/status/1651645370898989057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;April 27, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What disheartens me the most is that some of the users who are refusing to condemn this behaviour towards a spouse label themselves proudly as Christian. I used to call myself a Christian but one of the reasons I left Christianity is the refusal of the community, priests, bishops, and pope to explicitly classify what is wrong and the blatant hypocrisy when it comes to practical real life instances of injustice when actions aren&amp;rsquo;t barred by the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let me clarify what abuse is and what emotional abuse is. One definition of abuse is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;speak in an insulting and offensive way to or about (someone).
&amp;ldquo;the referee was abused by players from both teams&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being abusive in this context isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly correct because a hockey player being abusive towards a referee when losing does not exactly make the hockey player evil. So we have to use a more stricter definition that gives weight to &amp;ldquo;emotional.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to define &amp;ldquo;emotional abuse&amp;rdquo; is to use the definition given by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thehotline.org/resources/what-is-emotional-abuse/&#34;&gt;National Domestic Violence Hotline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t want you going out with them. I trust you; I just don’t trust them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NDVH&amp;rsquo;s first example is an example that doesn&amp;rsquo;t even show narcissism or victim blaming. Crowder told his pregnant wife to not take the car because he might need to go to the gym. He instead told her to get an Uber and considered her calling a friend to pick her up a threat. It would only be considered a threat to someone with a guilty consciousness. In what world is &amp;ldquo;okay, I&amp;rsquo;ll call my friend to pick me up&amp;rdquo; a threat? Only in the real world where you are entitled to a car over your pregnant wife and want her to take an uber but are not okay taking an Uber yourself. The entitlement itself makes Crowder a bad person, but his dictation to not take the car plus the &amp;ldquo;threat&amp;rdquo; comment makes this emotional abuse. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re going against me? How could you&amp;rdquo; is a classic playbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emotional abuse includes non-physical behaviors that are meant to control, isolate, or frighten you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest red flag is that Crowder, who earns more money in one month than my parents do in one year and earns more in one year than our family is worth, has one car whereas my family has two cars. The cheapness argument cannot be used since there&amp;rsquo;s a literal pool in the backyard. Some people might give the situation the benefit of the doubt that the second car was in the shop, but then two partners should be accommodating instead of saying &amp;ldquo;feeling some constraints&amp;rdquo; in the tone a 6 year old uses. He says that he &amp;ldquo;can&amp;rsquo;t go to the gym&amp;rdquo; but then says he &amp;ldquo;can&amp;rsquo;t be at home,&amp;rdquo; which at first it may allude to the wife controlling him, but the last comment just means that it&amp;rsquo;s a figure of speech not literal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He asserts that his wife is not doing &lt;em&gt;wifely&lt;/em&gt; things, and ignoring that gender roles don&amp;rsquo;t exactly exist, his idea of &lt;em&gt;wifely&lt;/em&gt; things is a pregnant woman carrying wooden pallets and a grill?? Hello? My parents get groceries together every week or two. They only go alone if there&amp;rsquo;s something missing that they themselves need or if the person who is busy can&amp;rsquo;t get themselves. It is absolutely absurd to assume your spouse can read your mind and go to the grocery store to get it for you. Even when his wife says that she will get the things he needs, he says &amp;ldquo;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t work either,&amp;rdquo; so clearly the issue is that he just doesn&amp;rsquo;t want her to take the car and come back at an unknown time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another comment that stuck out is &amp;ldquo;Do you understand the difference between my life being set to the second and you&amp;rsquo;re going to be back when your back&amp;rdquo; as if his wife is the one telling Crowder what to do but his later comment especially&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Walk the dogs and put on some gloves&amp;rdquo; to show her commitment to him. I don&amp;rsquo;t know about everyone else, but I don&amp;rsquo;t tell people to do things for me that I can do myself. I usually say &amp;ldquo;Could you do this for me&amp;rdquo; and I definitely wouldn&amp;rsquo;t ask my pregnant wife to walk the dogs and put some gloves on (in reference to her concern that touching the medication is toxic to pregnant women).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, the video was harder to watch a second time since it goes against everything my parents taught me about ethics and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty much done trying to convince people that Steven Crowder is completely in the wrong here regardless of if his wife was being controlling outside of the video (p.s. he wasn&amp;rsquo;t at the hospital when she gave birth).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Transcription&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly what was said, but it&amp;rsquo;s useful as a guideline to watch the speech I referenced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#d0d0d0;background-color:#202020;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-txt&#34; data-lang=&#34;txt&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[00:00.000 --&amp;gt; 00:06.000]  Because I drew a boundary. I drew a boundary. No, no, you just did it. You just did it.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[00:06.000 --&amp;gt; 00:10.000]  I drew a boundary in abuse of control. You were not taking the car.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[00:10.000 --&amp;gt; 00:16.000]  Because if you refuse to do rightful things, then I will go pick up the grocery.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[00:18.000 --&amp;gt; 00:23.000]  Steaks, wood pellets, my grill. I know it&amp;#39;s not a reasonable workbook.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[00:23.000 --&amp;gt; 00:27.000]  But I&amp;#39;ll go do it. How about a huge purse?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[00:27.000 --&amp;gt; 00:29.000]  How do you respond to that?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[00:29.000 --&amp;gt; 00:32.000]  Other than that, I&amp;#39;m the man.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[00:32.000 --&amp;gt; 00:38.000]  I don&amp;#39;t know. Other than that, I&amp;#39;m the man.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[00:38.000 --&amp;gt; 00:40.000]  No, you&amp;#39;re not taking the car.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[00:40.000 --&amp;gt; 00:42.000]  You&amp;#39;re not taking the car.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[00:42.000 --&amp;gt; 00:44.000]  Then I will ask them to pick up the car.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[00:44.000 --&amp;gt; 00:46.000]  What would you like them to ask?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[00:46.000 --&amp;gt; 00:47.000]  Oh, that&amp;#39;s right.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[00:47.000 --&amp;gt; 00:49.000]  Give it an Uber.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[00:49.000 --&amp;gt; 00:52.000]  Okay, Stephen, I can&amp;#39;t.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[00:52.000 --&amp;gt; 00:54.000]  Feeling some constraints?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[00:54.000 --&amp;gt; 00:56.000]  Stephen, I can&amp;#39;t see them.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[00:56.000 --&amp;gt; 00:59.000]  Listen to me. You want to walk out right now? Listen to me.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[00:59.000 --&amp;gt; 01:02.000]  I can&amp;#39;t go to the gym. I can&amp;#39;t go to my parents. I can&amp;#39;t call my friends.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:02.000 --&amp;gt; 01:05.000]  I can&amp;#39;t go. I can&amp;#39;t be home. You&amp;#39;re going to take the car and leave me here.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:05.000 --&amp;gt; 01:07.000]  Hillary, just think of how boxed in you&amp;#39;ve made me.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:07.000 --&amp;gt; 01:10.000]  What do you need me to pick up? I&amp;#39;ll get it. I&amp;#39;ll be back when I&amp;#39;m back.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:10.000 --&amp;gt; 01:13.000]  No, that doesn&amp;#39;t work either or you&amp;#39;ll be back when you&amp;#39;re back.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:13.000 --&amp;gt; 01:15.000]  It doesn&amp;#39;t work either.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:15.000 --&amp;gt; 01:20.000]  Do you understand the difference between my life being set to the setting and you&amp;#39;re going to be back when I&amp;#39;m back?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:20.000 --&amp;gt; 01:22.000]  Stephen.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:25.000 --&amp;gt; 01:28.000]  The only way out of this is disciplinary stuff.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:28.000 --&amp;gt; 01:30.000]  It&amp;#39;s the only way out of this when we&amp;#39;re at an impact.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:30.000 --&amp;gt; 01:32.000]  You&amp;#39;re going to be back.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:32.000 --&amp;gt; 01:34.000]  Good. Because you can&amp;#39;t have any disciplinary stuff.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:34.000 --&amp;gt; 01:36.000]  There you go.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:36.000 --&amp;gt; 01:38.000]  You throw your hand. You give up so easily.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:38.000 --&amp;gt; 01:39.000]  I don&amp;#39;t give up so easily.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:39.000 --&amp;gt; 01:40.000]  You give up so easily?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:40.000 --&amp;gt; 01:42.000]  I just said the only way out of this is disciplinary stuff.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:42.000 --&amp;gt; 01:44.000]  You said then we&amp;#39;re at an impact.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:44.000 --&amp;gt; 01:46.000]  No, we are at an impact.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:46.000 --&amp;gt; 01:48.000]  I love you, but Stephen.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:48.000 --&amp;gt; 01:50.000]  Your piece is sick.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:50.000 --&amp;gt; 01:52.000]  Your piece is sick.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:52.000 --&amp;gt; 01:54.000]  Watch it.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:54.000 --&amp;gt; 01:56.000]  Fucking watch it.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:56.000 --&amp;gt; 01:58.000]  I&amp;#39;m going to let go.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:58.000 --&amp;gt; 02:00.000]  I&amp;#39;ll get what you need me to get.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:00.000 --&amp;gt; 02:02.000]  And I need some space.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:02.000 --&amp;gt; 02:04.000]  You need to just talk to me a little bit.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:04.000 --&amp;gt; 02:06.000]  I love you.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:06.000 --&amp;gt; 02:08.000]  I love you very much.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:08.000 --&amp;gt; 02:10.000]  I don&amp;#39;t love you. That&amp;#39;s the big problem.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:10.000 --&amp;gt; 02:12.000]  I&amp;#39;ve never received love from you.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:12.000 --&amp;gt; 02:14.000]  And the fact is when I go, look, I need an A, B, C, and D.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:14.000 --&amp;gt; 02:16.000]  You just be disciplined about it.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:16.000 --&amp;gt; 02:18.000]  But I love you more than life itself.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:18.000 --&amp;gt; 02:20.000]  Okay, put on some gloves.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:20.000 --&amp;gt; 02:22.000]  No, but I love you more than life itself.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:22.000 --&amp;gt; 02:24.000]  That&amp;#39;s not fair. That&amp;#39;s not fair. And it&amp;#39;s disingenuous.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:24.000 --&amp;gt; 02:26.000]  Hillary, you&amp;#39;re right.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:26.000 --&amp;gt; 02:28.000]  Right in the ass.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:28.000 --&amp;gt; 02:30.000]  Become someone who&amp;#39;s needed.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:30.000 --&amp;gt; 02:32.000]  Day in and day out.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:32.000 --&amp;gt; 02:34.000]  Worthy of a life.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:34.000 --&amp;gt; 02:36.000]  No, not of the life.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:36.000 --&amp;gt; 02:38.000]  Hillary, come on now.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:38.000 --&amp;gt; 02:40.000]  I&amp;#39;m not going to engage. I&amp;#39;m not going to engage anymore.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:40.000 --&amp;gt; 02:42.000]  I&amp;#39;m going to go. I&amp;#39;ll get what you need.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:42.000 --&amp;gt; 02:44.000]  I&amp;#39;ll get what you need.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:44.000 --&amp;gt; 02:46.000]  I love you.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:46.000 --&amp;gt; 02:48.000]  I commit it to you.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:48.000 --&amp;gt; 02:50.000]  I love you.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:50.000 --&amp;gt; 02:52.000]  I commit it to you.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:52.000 --&amp;gt; 02:54.000]  Fuck that.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:54.000 --&amp;gt; 02:56.000]  That&amp;#39;s the gloves.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:56.000 --&amp;gt; 02:58.000]  Are you committed enough to do these things?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:58.000 --&amp;gt; 03:00.000]  Are you committed enough to do those things?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[03:00.000 --&amp;gt; 03:02.000]  You&amp;#39;re not committed to anything.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[03:02.000 --&amp;gt; 03:04.000]  You&amp;#39;re not committed to anything.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[03:04.000 --&amp;gt; 03:05.920]  You just said I love you.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[03:05.920 --&amp;gt; 03:08.000]  Walk the dogs front and closed.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[03:08.000 --&amp;gt; 03:10.000]  Walk the dog front and closed.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[03:10.000 --&amp;gt; 03:12.000]  Are you committed enough to do those things?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[03:12.000 --&amp;gt; 03:14.000]  Are you committed enough to do those things?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[03:14.000 --&amp;gt; 03:16.000]  I&amp;#39;m committed.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[03:16.000 --&amp;gt; 03:18.000]  Walk the dogs front and closed.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[03:18.000 --&amp;gt; 03:20.000]  Are you committed enough to do the medication?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[03:20.000 --&amp;gt; 03:22.000]  Walk the dog front and closed.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[03:22.000 --&amp;gt; 03:24.000]  Take care.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

      <title>Fixed Seats Proportional Representation (FSP-R)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This article describes and demonstrates a novel solution for electoral reform called Fixed Seats Proportional Representation (FSP / FSP-R, previously called representative proportional voting) - similar to the open-list proportional representation system used by Finland - that it is practical to implement. It is also more effective in holding elections where every vote contributes to the formation of a government body. Below is the overall results of the 2021 Canadian general election under the presently used &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=res&amp;amp;dir=ces&amp;amp;document=part1&amp;amp;lang=e#p13&#34;&gt;First Past the Post (FPTP)&lt;/a&gt; electoral system compared to FSP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;Party&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;FPTP Seats&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;FPTP Seats %&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;FSP Seats&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;FSP Seats %&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;Vote %&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve included this table at the top to highlight how ineffective the current electoral system is at giving voters a voice. From a numerical point of view, by analyzing each district, FPTP resulted in &lt;strong&gt;52.15% of all votes (8,883,902), NOT GOING TOWARDS AN ELECTED MP SITTING IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS!&lt;/strong&gt;. In contrast, under FSP, 99% of votes went towards an elected candidate.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2021 Canadian general elections had just passed and I was curious as to how proportional the election results were. I noticed that the Liberals were over-represented. I then began a thought experiment on what an ideal democratic electoral process would look like for Canadian parliamentary elections. When the Liberal party led by Justin Trudeau came into power in 2015, one of their promises was electoral reform of the First Past the Post system currently in use. However, as the last elections have shown us, the Liberal party is substantially benefitting from First Past the Post and it is not strategic for them to follow through on their first campaign promise.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of Canadians demand electoral reform without suggestions as to how, while others criticize common proportional voting system (e.g. party-list) for lacking &amp;ldquo;local representation.&amp;rdquo; There are also others asserting or even bringing up ranked ballots as the holy grail for democracy, but I digress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ranked-ballots&#34; &gt;Ranked Ballots
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#ranked-ballots&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ranked ballots work great when it&amp;rsquo;s just for one localized governance, such as mayor or a university student association. If it were applied to federal elections we would still not have proportional representation. Rather, we would see an amalgamation of parties most closely aligned (vote A if not vote B). Ranked voting is strategic voting and minority voters would still be &lt;strong&gt;unrepresented&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fspr-overview&#34; &gt;FSPR Overview
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#fspr-overview&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;FSPR is similar to the open-list PR system used in Finland with two caveats being that independent candidates still have a chance and that the huntington-hill method is used to appropriate seats rather than the D&amp;rsquo;Hondt method. This new system is applicable to provincial/territorial &amp;amp; federal elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voters will vote for their preferred candidate and if they prefer an independent candidate, they can further rank these independent candidates and rank a party-affiliated candidate last, A run-off is held for votes going towards independent candidates are collapsed until the last independent candidate remains. An independent candidates can be elected if they win the First Past the Post manner. Otherwise, they are eliminated and the rankings go to party-affiliated candidates that were ranked last. The votes going towards each of the remaining party candidates are considered as party votes and are pooled for the region. The remaining seats are distributed proportionally based on which districts had the highest percentage support for each party (note that highest percentage support does not necessarily mean the popular vote in that district).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example to illustrate my point. Say that there is party A that would win the popular vote in every district, and party B which got the rest of the votes for each district. The seats party B and A are entitled to is determined in a round robin fashion of selecting the district that had the greatest percentage support for said party. The order is least seats to most seats to ensure that the smaller parties get districts they had high support in. Otherwise we might get a less than optimal distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of a province or territory that only has one seat, a ranked ballot with runoff would suffice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;One possible criticism is that there will be ridings where the candidate that is elected didn&amp;rsquo;t get second or third either. This is a valid tradeoff since the current situation is that your vote would be meaningless if the representative of the other party got even one more vote than the party-affiliated representative you voted for. With my proposed FSP, all votes will matter even in hindsight. So the upsides are that: independent representatives are favoured, one of the running candidates will win the riding, every vote counts towards the governing body rather than only for a singular riding, and the democratically elected body is proportional to how voters voted.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To incentivize and protect independent candidates, we give independents priority when picking representatives for each riding. If they were to be included in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington-Hill_method&#34;&gt;Huntington-Hill&lt;/a&gt; method for proportional seat distribution, it would be possible for no seat to be allocated to them since party&amp;rsquo;s would have a greater proportion of votes. This is why I kept the same voting procedures / logistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll probably hear people complaining about a non-FPTP candidate winning. No candidate should be entitled to represent a riding without 50% of support and a ranked ballot is not guaranteed to reflect the federal wide policies voters want. Therefore, FSP is a valid Canadian-centred compromise. I will now dive into the technicalities as well as the practical results if FSP was the system used in the last election.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fsp-algorithm&#34; &gt;FSP Algorithm
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#fsp-algorithm&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is simply amazing that computer science can even be applied to politics. I&amp;rsquo;ve outlined the algorithm for FSP below. Note that this version of the algorithm and the election results distribute seats on a federal level rather than on a region level. I will update the algorithm and results soon. It incorporates many concepts such as FPTP, Huntington-Hill (fun fact is that it is used for the electoral college points in the U.S.A.), Hare Quota, and even ranked ballots (for niche situations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just like how it is presently, each person will vote for a candidate in their riding with some exception.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voters voting for an independent candidate are allowed to rank their preferences for independent candidates with their final choice optionally being a party-affiliated candidate. This ensures that their vote won&amp;rsquo;t be lost if no independent candidate won.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provinces &amp;amp; territories that only have one seat in the house of commons should be using ranked ballots. In this manner, voters of each province &amp;amp; territory get to choose best how their seats will be distributed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once all the votes are counted per riding, determine independent candidates that won via the current FPTP method. Eliminate and use the ranking system to determine who the most popular independent candidate is. If they got a higher vote than the party candidates, then they win the riding according to FPTP. Otherwise, eliminate this independent candidate to get the number of votes for each party. Note that party candidates are not elected on a FPTP basis, which is why the party vote count is what is important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove the ridings that were won by independent candidates from all available ridings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington-Hill_method&#34;&gt;Huntington-Hill method&lt;/a&gt; to determine number of seats to allocate to each party (independents are not considered a party).
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will use the  &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hare_quota&#34;&gt;Hare quota&lt;/a&gt; to determine whether a party deserves a single seat; The total votes (minus independent votes) divided by the total seats available (after removing independent won seats).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initially allocate one seat to each party that meets this quota and discard all parties and independents that did not meet this quota.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allocate seats to whichever party has the highest seat priority until total seats have been allocated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The seat priority is calculated using &lt;img class=equation-tall src=&#34;https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?A_n^2=\frac{V^2}{n(n+1)}&#34;&gt; where V is the the number of votes that party received, and n is the number of seats that party has been allocated so far.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assign seats based on highest proportion of votes per riding.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sort parties in &lt;strong&gt;ascending&lt;/strong&gt; order based on number of seats allocated and prefer parties with higher votes to break ties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iterate over the parties in the previous order until all parties have had their seats assigned to a riding.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For each party that has unassigned seats, assign a seat to an unelected riding with the highest percentage voting for that party.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a list or graph of all ridings with their assigned representative to keep track of seat assignment / election results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Methodology: I wrote Python code that downloaded 2021 election polling data, transformed that data to be useful, implemented the FSP algorithm, supplied data to the algorithm, and lastly summarized the results for consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s clear that under FSP, we can get a 99% representative government body where the 1% that went unrepresented voted for parties that got less than ~50,000 votes (Hare Quota).
For the list of ridings that would have a different representative, you can download &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/elibroftw/representative-proportional-voting/releases/download/2021/districts.csv&#34;&gt;a CSV of the compiled results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some notable points are that all elected parties would have more seats than the proportional vote because 1% of votes went to very unpopular parties. The liberals lose 49 seats, NDP doubles their seat count, and the PPC ends up getting more than double the seats than what Green would get. This sort of system would force all parties to reach out to every voter even in districts that are considered wins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this is a post-election analysis, numbers for some parties will be under-represented even though they won more seats. For example, it is common for voters to vote Liberals just so that the Conservatives don&amp;rsquo;t win and it&amp;rsquo;s possible some people voted Conservative instead of PPC so that the Liberals don&amp;rsquo;t win. Therefore, under FSP, we could reasonably expect bigger parties to lose even more seats to smaller parties. This logic does extend to parties on the same side of the spectrum such as the Green party. As seen in the CSV provided, we could see Green party getting seats that would have been NDP under FPTP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FSP would do away with strategic voting to the point where it would be ignorant to vote for a party other than the one you genuinely support. A greater proportional system
would also promote bootstrapping of parties as support only needs to be nation wide to win a seat rather than concentrated in one riding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the FSP system, 99% of voters ended up represented. The votes of the 1%, although divided, do matter in aggregate. For example, the Free Party had just under the threshold to get a seat. Every vote really does matter under FSP compared to FPTP, where voting might have seemed like a waste of time in hindsight. Only under an FSP system would I ever support a policy that forced citizens to check into a polling station to vote or explicitly abstain from voting. There would be almost no subjective reasons to avoid voting under FSP as it would be in direct opposition to your interests.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, every voter&amp;rsquo;s voice matters under FSP. If I was/am ever an MP or MPP, I would propose to use this method for all provincial/territorial and federal elections. I strongly believe that under FSP, Canada will be setting the standard for a democracy where each citizen&amp;rsquo;s voice is valued due to aggregation rather than the current system where a vote only goes as far as the district.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One criticism that I can see for my own method is that independent candidates are given a relatively unfair advantage to win their riding. However, an independent candidate will most likely lack the financial + labour + social resources
that party-affiliated candidates will have. Our country is considered a democracy even with the FPTP electoral system, so allowing independent candidates to make use of it in a reformed electoral system is really not a good argument especially when results are more democratic anyways. The majority of Canadians have not experienced something better than First Past the Post in the &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CSV file provided can be used to draw a colored map of each riding as well as to summarize which parties traded seats. For example, Conservatives went down 4 seats in total, but if you look at the CSV, half the seats lost were to the PPC and the other half to the NDP. They gained most of these seats back from the Liberals and some from the Bloc Québécois. Zero seats were lost to the Liberals. Another example is that the NDP lost two seats to the Green party and one seat to the PPC. That one seat is the only seat the PPC gained from a party other than the Conservatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hypothesis is that this type of system would force the mainstream parties to invite smaller parties to debates. Otherwise the smaller party voters would simply not watch the debates and vote for the smaller party anyways.
We know that the PPC got votes even with the backdrop of strategic voting, but only under FPTP does 5% round down to 0%. In a proportional system, all parties had more seats proportional than voters&amp;rsquo; choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a system countries like Norway use, however the main point is to make electoral reform easy, simple, and effective with minimal tradeoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;electoral-misconduct&#34; &gt;Electoral Misconduct
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#electoral-misconduct&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like with every law and system, there will be people trying to bend it. One such situation I could forsee far into the future are candidates running as an independents but supported by a party through advertisements/funding. Elections Canada would be tasked at ensuring such &lt;del&gt;&lt;em&gt;faltugiri&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/del&gt; horsing around would  be met with major fines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-notes&#34; &gt;Other Notes

    &lt;a href=&#34;#other-notes&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a good argument on whether or not proportional voting or democracy is even a good idea if the possibility of extreme actions can affect the majority of people. A good example that was brought up is that public transit doesn&amp;rsquo;t run on Sabbath, but the minister of transportation is driven around in a car just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, it was a good question and it made me think of at what point should a minority opinion be given credence. I use Firefox and I would like to switch to using Fedora KDE in the future. Therefore, minority opinions, are important and I think 1% of the population should be a threshold, not the 1 seat threshold I have used. The election results would still be the same as what I have provided, however it would ensure that people can&amp;rsquo;t just take unpopular issues and be represented so easily. There&amp;rsquo;s a big difference between the PPC leader being the MP for his riding and a fringe party being the MP of a riding where they only have the support of 1.5% constituents (1% average nation wide). So of course, 1% of the nation should also involve having 10% in any riding.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pierre Poilievre Policies</title>
      <link>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/pierre-poilievre-policies/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Sep 2022 17:39:09 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/pierre-poilievre-policies/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m making this blog post and video to document (practical?) policies that I&amp;rsquo;ve heard/read Pierre Poilievre express.
For each policy, I will include the excerpt as well as my analysis of it to connect the dots between stated policy and desired / expected results. This is evident in the first policy that incentivized me to create this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;housing-affordability&#34; &gt;Housing Affordability
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#housing-affordability&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timestamp &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/Z39VZGF2k0A?t=608&#34;&gt;Pierre Poilievre C-31 Response @ 10:08&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[En Français] The conservative government will tie infrastructure dollars for major cities where properties are too expensive to the number of housing units built. This will help to reduce the cost of construction permits, allow us to build more, and we will insist that every time the federal government has a new transit station that the land around must have houses and apartments in order to densify so that people can live near public transit. And third, we will sell 15% of the 37,000 [5,550] federal buildings in order to transform them into housing and create millions and millions places for young people to live and start their families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis: By tying infrastructure $ to # houses built for specific cities, cities will have a great incentive to allow more houses to be built, and since they want to get more net money, they would have to allow more permits, speed up constructions (possible by improving efficiency of inspections since the city itself isn&amp;rsquo;t the builder); To allow more permits, either costs go down so that more builders apply (I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how expensive construction permits are but if they are 100k+ then yeah its a barrier to entry and causes higher housing prices), or approval process improves. A faster approval process means there is a greater incoming supply of housing every year. The next point is to INSIST not ENFORCE federal departments to build public transit stations around places where people live. The intention is to densify (true, cities like Toronto have low density compared to other cities) as areas with public transit are more desirable and thus more housing units will be built there (higher willingness to pay therefore higher incentive to supply). It&amp;rsquo;s important that this is an insist and not an enforcement to account for the &amp;laquo; rare &amp;raquo; case that near max densification and public transit has occurred. There will always be edge cases on building transit like for example planned development. So by saying insist and not enforce the government doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to add more bureaucratic measures. An enforcement would basically entail a/many new minister(s) in charge of approving every transit station proposed by the relevant department in charge of public transit (department of transportation?). Additional bureaucracy would be hypocritical for the CPC, specifically Poilievre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poilievre&amp;rsquo;s last point is to sell ~5,500 federal buildings and transform them into housing to create MM and MM&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of places to live, and this is an obvious hyperbole. It&amp;rsquo;s impossible to put a fine number but if we assumed each of these buildings were to be replaced by an apartment, we could see 132 * 5,500 = 742,000 housing units. The 132 units per apartment building comes from Quora so the total units is ball park figure but better than a hyperbole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I myself had not thought of this policy and it&amp;rsquo;s great Poilievre came up with something new that can be summarized as bullying (my words not his) or incentivize cities into submission rather than trying to impede their municipal rights. This is a heck of a lot more practical than simply stating &amp;ldquo;we will increase construction permit approvals.&amp;rdquo; The policies I had come up with to address housing affordability can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/canada/#housing-affordability&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://calgaryherald.com/opinion/columnists/varcoe-stay-in-your-lane-after-victory-against-bill-c-69-alberta-emboldened-in-feud-with-feds&#34;&gt;Constitutional challenge successful&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Impact Assessment ACt (IAA) stipulates that an impact assessment is necessary when a &lt;a href=&#34;https://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-2.75/page-1.html#1160090&#34;&gt;designated project&lt;/a&gt; (a physical activity on Canadian land and has been designated by the Minister of Environment. Where that list of regulations made for physical activities is? No idea).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;rsquo;t much information on this topic, but from &lt;a href=&#34;https://atbcapitalmarkets.com/insights/the-bill-c-69-aftermath&#34;&gt;https://atbcapitalmarkets.com/insights/the-bill-c-69-aftermath&lt;/a&gt;, it seems Bill-69 could potentially create infinite delays; incorporate &amp;rsquo;traditional Indigenous knowledge&amp;rsquo; and &amp;rsquo;the intersection of sex and gender with other identity factors&amp;rsquo; which is ridiculous if the topic at hand is natural gas, oil sands, or a Uranium mine; THE MINISTER OF THE ENVIRONMENT HAS VETO POWER WITH EVERY PROPOSAL!!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even without any funding by corporations, being against this bill has merit. Poilievre is arguing from a point of improving energy independence, however I feel that the benefits are much more broader and not just restricted to energy. The bill supposedly impeding pipelines does have some merit as presently any pipeline proposal could be declined simply because the Minister of Environment doesn&amp;rsquo;t want it approved or stalled by the Governor in Council.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill C-395 was sponsored by Poilievre  in 2018 as a private member&amp;rsquo;s bill. The goal of this bill was to ensure that people with disability benefits could continuing receiving those benefits while working.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is that politicians need to be forced to keep the budget balanced in order to reduce debt and prevent excess aggregate demand (→ inflation).
Poilievre used the bill under Clinton as an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This specific part is similar to Trumps speech pattern that will undoubtedly be used as a rebuttal against Poilievre although it has nothing to do with his policies. I am stating this in case someone tries to call me biased for not addressing/catching the speech similarity.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Understanding the USA Amendments</title>
      <link>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/understanding-usa-amendments/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 11:15:56 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/understanding-usa-amendments/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The language used in the Bill of Rights of the USA is 200+ years old. It is not clear that everyone in the present day would
understand what some of the terms even means, and then we need to understand the background and the context as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my attempt at doing just that. I stopped caring after Amendment XVI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;amendment-i&#34; &gt;Amendment I
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#amendment-i&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress should not endorse a religion; Congress should be secular in nature. Therefore, there shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be any favourtism of religions at play.
Tradition might include God, but one can argue that tradition would be counter to the will of the Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress should not prohibit the exercise of somoene&amp;rsquo;s religion. Whether that&amp;rsquo;d be Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consequence of both of this statement is that the government should be secular in decision making skill while not
preventing people from practicing thier religion. So something like banning the hijab or religious symbols for public servant positions
would be against the constitution, while at the same time the public servants would not be allowed to put forth laws to be pro their religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is very important to note that abridging is barred by Congress rather than allowing abridging and nothing else. This key distinction
means that the amendment should be applied very liberally. The right to free speech should be absolute as long as it isn&amp;rsquo;t violating the Bill of Rights
of other people. For example, speaking very loudly at 3am disturbs your neighbours and thus their security of their house is being violated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the hard questions, since it is to be applied liberally, spewing hate is allowed as long as the other person&amp;rsquo;s right to security isn&amp;rsquo;t
being harmed. You are allowed to critize people but when you start calling for their death unironically or whatever, you would be violating their
right to security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another conseuqnce is that something like the Sikh exemption for motorcycle helmets in Canada would be respecting an establishment of religion since
it allows Sihks to not wear a helmet because they practice a religion that says not to cut their hair. If the goal is to force people to be safe,
then a religious exemption implies that the government is fine with putting riders in danger because they are part of a religion! Hair is not
going to protect you if you fall! People will argue that no exemption would be discriminatory, but safety protocols don&amp;rsquo;t discriminate. IF
someone&amp;rsquo;s religion tomorrow says to keep uranium in their house, is the government going to let them do that? No, that&amp;rsquo;s unsafe, and same goes
for this scenario. I only found out about this because I was interested in getting a motorcycle license in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#amendment-ii&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is such a controversial amendment. We&amp;rsquo;ll split it up into two parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Militia (American Revolutionary Wars):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;groups of able-bodied men who protected their towns, colonies, and eventually states&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern translation: Groups of people without health complications who are capable of using modern weapons to defend their town or state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This job usually falls into the hands of the municipal police or the state police, except that the state and municpal police enforce
the Federal governments laws rather than defending their town/state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can see from history that Arms included (semi-automatic): pistols, muskets (modern day shotgun because of range), long-range rifles, swords, axes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting it together, people need access to guns in order to form militias to keep a nation secure. Semi-automatic guns are a given due to
this amendment, for able-bodiied people that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to autmatic weapons, this is wear prudence is required. Should city police forces even be allowed to hold automatic guns?
No. A militia is for the state rather than the town, so the authority over automatic guns should be given to the state and distributed to various
areas in the state in case the weapons do need to be distributed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem in America (generally speaking of course) is that &amp;ldquo;able-bodied people&amp;rdquo; is not relevant to Red States and
&amp;ldquo;the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed&amp;rdquo; is not relevant to Blue states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These great blunders cause polarization which only hurts the freedom and security of the entire country since each side limits the freedom or security
of the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;amendment-iii&#34; &gt;Amendment III
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#amendment-iii&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is very vague and probably has to do with the context surrounding the American Revolutionary War. If somone owns a house, soldiers can&amp;rsquo;t just use it
how they please with the justification being that they represent the state. That&amp;rsquo;s why soliders would need to follow laws, and the constitution makes it clear
that the laws should balance property rights with the security of the nation. That is, the owner&amp;rsquo;s lifestyle and property should be respected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;amendment-iv&#34; &gt;Amendment IV

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person should feel safe existing, their autonomy should not be threatened, and neither their freedom nor lifestyle unless, unless a Warrant was issued for probable cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn&amp;rsquo;t really protect abortion rights as people may think. This is one of the amendments that needs to be elaborated or split into two since
it doesnt&amp;rsquo; specify property rights or what security even means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;amendment-v&#34; &gt;Amendment V

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No person shall be punished without a grand jury indictment unless public danger or war is at play where waiting on a grand jury would result in more casulties.
You also can&amp;rsquo;t indict a person for the same crime (action), force them to testify against themselves, nor be deprived of life (e.g. not given food), liberty (can&amp;rsquo;t do activites normal people could do), or property, without due process of law;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government can&amp;rsquo;t nationalize things without compensating the owner of said property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forces the government to prove that the accused were criminals in a timely manner, otherwise there is room for abuse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The accused has a right to legal representation&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could use inflation and you&amp;rsquo;d get $671.94 today, but this is way too small. We need to take into account how much $20 was worth (divide by median wage)
and compare the same to today. Even this calculation is not perfect. In 1776, the median household income for free colonialists was $377 &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjfgIeQ0N_4AhUuMlkFHcZxDoEQFnoECAMQAQ&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Feml.berkeley.edu%2F~webfac%2Fcromer%2Fe211_f12%2FLindertWilliamson.pdf&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw18dzMXqJ_foFO1vT1H55o5&#34;&gt;src&lt;/a&gt;. Presently (2020), the median houshold income is $67,521 &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2021/demo/p60-273.html&#34;&gt;src&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, a more accurate number would be $4,000 (20/377 * 67,521 rounded up to nearest single digit with 0s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;amendment-viii&#34; &gt;Amendment VIII

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bail should be an amount that is significant to people. A poor person cannot afford thousands of dollars in bail.
Excessive fines meaning that a person should not have to sell things to pay a fine. A fine is meant to deter but not harm.
Cruel and unusual meaning that punishments should not be becomes worse over time and cruel meaning that the punishment fits the
crime. Subjecting humans to a lifetime of cell is cruel. If you want to isolate someone from society for the rest of their life,
then make a prison that isn&amp;rsquo;t cruel but only allows them to interact with people who consent to them. I believe that
if we&amp;rsquo;re going to just put people in cells for the rest of their lives, we might as well sentence them to death and avoid
all the complications. White collar crimes are the worst. Why bother giving a prison sentence, just hit the restart button
on their lives. Why take away their tax contributions? Just take away 90-95% of their assets. Some people might
see this as being more cruel or even unconstitutional, but taking away freedom is much worse than taking away someone&amp;rsquo;s materialism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a hard one to comprehend but essential means that you cannot use the constitution to contradict other parts of the constitution
and so each right is not ranked but rather balanced among each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically any powers that Congress was not explicitly given the right to govern over by the constitution, should be left to the states to govern. This is so incredibly important and basically means that State government plays a bigger role than the federal government when it comes to daily life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;amendment-xiii&#34; &gt;Amendment XIII
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#amendment-xiii&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right to not be involuntary be put to work unless it is punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure why slavery is allowed for the punished. The punishment of criminals is that they don&amp;rsquo;t get to enjoy freedoms. To force them to work,
is beyond cruel. Criminals shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be forced to work but rather volunteer their efforts to climb up the prison heirarchy or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;amendment-xiv&#34; &gt;Amendment XIV
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#amendment-xiv&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citizenship procedure formally defined, as well as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is so important and goes beyond slavery and black Americans. This constitution imposes restrictions on not just the USA but also its States in terms of regulating
the life, liberty, and property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ammendment can be used to argue for abortion rights, gay-marriage, and etc. since they are issues concerning liberty and life and not the harm of other people.
Those arguments are not mine to make, as I don&amp;rsquo;t even live in America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;amendment-xv&#34; &gt;Amendment XV
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#amendment-xv&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The right to vote for every citizen no matter their demographic. I guess the 14th wasn&amp;rsquo;t clear enough so they had to explicitly say it. This is one
of the amendments that tell us that explicit is better than implicit and that issues like: gay marriage, inter-racial marriage, and abortion should be
amendments. There is no harm in redundancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;amendment-xvi&#34; &gt;Amendment XVI
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#amendment-xvi&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Income tax. The context of this situation is that the government was previously funded via tariffs and to lower these tarrifs income taxes were used.
Nowadays tarrifs still exist and income taxes are a much higher percentage and they are also applied on much higher salaries. The USA is simply lucky
with regard to its sheer mass size and population. A larger middle class population means higher innovation incendence, which means competitive advantages and etc.&lt;/p&gt;
